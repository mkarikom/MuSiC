\usage{
music.basic.ct(Y, X, S, Sigma.ct, iter.max, nu, eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{vector of bulk tissue expression}

\item{X}{matrix, Signature matrix}

\item{S}{vector of Avg. Library size}

\item{Sigma.ct}{matrix of Subject level variation with}

\item{iter.max}{numeric, maximum iteration number}

\item{nu}{regulation parameter, take care of weight when taking recipical}

\item{eps}{Thredshold of convergence}
}
\value{
a list with elements:
  * p.nnls: vector of cell type proportions estimated by nnls (add up to 1)
  * q.nnls: vector of original estimation from nnls
  * fit.nnls: fitted value of Y from nnls
  * resid.nnls: residual value from nnls
  * p.weight: vector of cell type proportions estimated by weighted-nnls (add up to 1)
  * q.weight: vector of original estimation from weight-nnls
  * fit.weight: fitted value of Y from weighted-nnls
  * resid.weight: residual value from weighted-nnls
  * weight.gene: weight calculated from weighted-nnls
  * converge: 'Reach Maxiter', 'Converge at m'
  * rsd: residual value from weighted-nnls transfromed by weight
  * R.squared: R square of weighted-nnls
  * var.p: variance of weighted-nnls estimated cell type proportions
}
\description{
weight is estimated with cell type covariance
