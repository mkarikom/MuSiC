  * q.nnls: vector of original estimation from nnls
  * fit.nnls: fitted value of Y from nnls
  * resid.nnls: residual value from nnls
  * p.weight: vector of cell type proportions estimated by weighted-nnls (add up to 1)
  * q.weight: vector of original estimation from weight-nnls
  * fit.weight: fitted value of Y from weighted-nnls
  * resid.weight: residual value from weighted-nnls
  * weight.gene: weight calculated from weighted-nnls
